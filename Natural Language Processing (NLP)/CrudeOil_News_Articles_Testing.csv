Big Oil Is Literally Burning Cash In The Permian.html,"Global oil giants are facing ever-increasing public pressure and higher levels of scrutiny over their responsibility to curb harmful greenhouse emissions. Yet, in the sprawling oilfields of Texas, New Mexico and North Dakota, an industry-old practice of burning off unwanted natural gas has refused to die.  The burning off (flaring), as well as the intentional release (venting) of natural gas, is proving to be a black eye that Permian producers just can’t get rid of. But investors are paying attention, and ESG (environmental, social and governance) investing isn’t just a passing fad--it’s a mega-trend now.  Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock--one of the world’s largest hedge funds, told CEOs around the world last month that climate change has become a “defining factor in companies’ long-term prospects”.  That, he said, would lead to a significant reallocation of capital--and it’s going to happen a lot sooner than anyone previously expected.  “For the first time since WWII we sense a shift in which climate and the environment — not growth — will become the priority of governments and their citizens, as shortages of food, clean water and air become existential questions,” Saxo Bank Chief Economist Steen Jakobsen said in his latest quarterly outlook report. So what will these huge funds think of the excessive flaring that’s going on in the Permian? Right now, they’re not thinking much of it, but they will--especially once the coronavirus vanishes and focus is once again on the industry’s activities.  Texas: The Flaring Capital Texas might be better known as home to the famous Permian Basin, the site of the world’s biggest oil boom. But it’s also quickly earning a dirty reputation as the epicenter of one of the country’s biggest energy wastes and associated air pollution.  Citing infrastructure limitations and safety issues, producers across some of the country’s largest oilfields are flaring natural gas at record levels, despite emissions commitments.       According to data from Rystad Energy via Reuters, the Permian basin flared a staggering 293.2 billion cubic feet of natural gas, more than 3x the amount of gas produced by the most prolific gas facility in the Gulf of Mexico and enough to power more than 7 million American homes for a whole year.                                          Flaring--the deliberate burning of unwanted polluting gas--has become an acute problem in Texas, home to most of the Permian reservoir, a sprawling 86,000 square miles (220,000 km2) oilfield straddling two states. Loose regulations in Texas compared to New Mexico means producers like Exxon, privately held BTA Oil Producers and Matador Resources burn significantly more gas in their Texas oilfields compared to those in New Mexico. Indeed, Rystad calculates that 83.5 percent of the gas flared in the Permian is done on the Texas side. However, these companies risk flaring their way out of big money as investors latch on to environmentalism and ESG investing gathers momentum. And then we’ve got the coronavirus and an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.  Rystad noted in a February newsletter that “the Permian keeps struggling and insufficient capacity for gas, its low-cost oil supply potential even at WTI of $50 per barrels has been proven across many parts of the basin”.

 But we’re not in a world of even $50 oil right now. $50, in fact, sounds smashing. Now, we’re in $30-$35 territory, and if excessive flaring doesn’t put off ESG-bound capital, there’s going to be even more because it’s the cheapest way to deal with it.  Small Producers Are Even Dirtier Despite natural gas being a viable fuel commodity, low market prices and limited transport infrastructure means companies often opt to burn it or simply release it into the atmosphere (venting).  They are, after all, more interested in the crude oil concealed beneath the surface.  Venting is less common with producers burning 2.6x as much gas as they vent. However, it’s even more deleterious than flaring because it releases unburned, odorless methane which is many times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Still, the amount of natural gas many companies are flaring is simply inexcusable.  Related: Why 2030 Isn’t The Magic Year For Electric Vehicles According to Reuters FactBox, Exxon flared around 6.6 percent of its natural gas production in the Permian last year. However, this is a tale of two states: It burned a lot more of that on the Texas side (17 percent) than it did on the New Mexico side (6.8 percent). Likewise, Matador Resources went on a flaring binge in Texas (6.8 percent), but toned down its flaring in New Mexico (1.7 percent). And the list goes on in this fashion, with BP highlighted as the most prolific flarer, burning 13.5 percent of its natural gas in the Permian last year.  Apache Corp. has a practice of not bringing wells online before installing pipeline transportation first. However, “third-party midstream operational issues” have forced the company to increase its flaring rate according to a company spokeswoman. Apache flared less than 1 percent of its gas in three counties; however, it burned a staggering 24 percent of its gas in one Texas county, Reuters notes, based on Rystad data.  Royal Dutch Shell is probably the ‘cleanest’ when it comes to flaring. The company only works in the Texas Permian where it burned off just 1.5 percent of its gas. Chevron Corp., EOG Resources, ConocoPhillips and Occidental Petroleum are all reported to have low flaring rates. On average, companies operating in the Permian flared 6.6 percent of their natural gas last year. Interestingly, smaller producers are actually more guilty of the practice than their bigger brethren. Indeed, a handful of companies that are nowhere near the top producers have an outsized role in the business of flaring.  (Click to enlarge) Source: Environmental Defense Fund Steward Energy II, for example, is the 60th largest producer in the Permian. However, the company was the fourth-largest flarer by volume (4.3 Bcf) in 2018. Steward actually flared more natural gas than XTO Energy, despite producing less than a tenth of XTO’s natural gas. Steward flared an incredible 64.5 percent of all the gas it produced, according to the EDF.  Another small company, Surge Operating LLC, flared 4.4 Bcf of natural gas, good for 22 percent of its total production thus qualifying as the 3rd largest flarer. Meanwhile, Jagged Peak Energy flared more than 3.5Bcf, or 19 percent of all the natural gas it produced.  Related: Oil Prices Rise As Trump Declares National Emergency Over Coronavirus Outbreak The good news is that the biggest producers are actually flaring less. According to the Environmental Defense Fund, some of the largest Permian producers have lowered their flaring rates compared to five years ago. That’s encouraging because it demonstrates that individual companies are, in fact, capable of reducing flaring.  (Click to enlarge) Source: Environmental Defense Fund The potential good news, however, is overshadowed by the blatant and excessive wastefulness of many operators that flare exceptionally high amounts of natural gas. In some cases, companies are even flaring all of their produced natural gas volume.  Loose Regulations Mounting pressure on the oil industry regarding its climate impact has forced some operators to pledge to reduce their flaring habits. However, recent research by Greenpeace’s investigative unit has unearthed how the practice remains rampant across giant U.S. oilfields, with oil majors BP and ExxonMobil among the worst offenders. A big part of it can be blamed on lax rules. Regulation is the big difference between Texas and New Mexico, with Texas having approved every permit for flaring or venting since 2013, Reuters reported.  In New Mexico, applications for flaring require a clear plan to capture gas and must be renewed every 30 days as opposed to Texas where renewals are good for six months. This has led to wildly different rates of flaring between the two states even by the same companies.  Perhaps the State of Texas ought to consider applying the existing gas production tax (7.5 percent) to flared gas. Currently, flared gas is exempt from production taxes, leading to unacceptable levels of harmful burning and potentially millions of dollars in tax revenue going up in smoke."
US Looks To Snag Market Share From Russia In Its Own Backyard.html,"The U.S. State Department has announced ""the willingness of U.S. companies to begin immediately selling oil to Belarus at competitive market prices"" in a clear signal to Minsk -- and neighboring Russia -- of Washington's desire to expand trade ties with the post-Soviet country of around 10 million people. A State Department spokesman said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had ""reiterated U.S. support for Belarusian sovereignty"" and ""discussed the potential to increase bilateral business ties"" in a March 13 phone call with Belarusian Foreign Minister Uladzimir Makei. The announcement comes a little over a month after Pompeo made the first trip to Belarus by a sitting U.S. secretary of state since 1994 and emerged saying the United States was seeking closer ties with Minsk but did not need to choose sides between Belarus and Russia. Belarus has spent decades being heavily reliant on Russia for cheap oil and gas as well as billions in annual subsidies to prop up its highly centralized economy.

 But it has been intense talks with Moscow over oil prices for months. Oil and gas disputes have sharpened a wider political discord between the two post-Soviet countries over forming a union that both sides pledged to in 1999. On March 11, Belarusian Prime Minister Syarhey Rumas said the sharp drop in oil prices had opened room for Minsk to reach an agreement with Moscow over supplies. In February, President Alyaksandr Lukashenka threatened to start tapping oil from a transit pipeline if Russia did not supply Belarus with the volumes of crude it needed. The 4,000-kilometer-long Druzhba pipeline crosses Belarusian territory and supplies about 1 million barrels of Russian oil to Europe per day. Druzhba oil deliveries were halted in April 2019 due to high concentrations of organic chloride found in the pipeline, a problem that caused months of friction and disputes. Lukashenka has been in power in Belarus for more than 25 years but has faced growing pressure from Moscow to agree to deeper integration under a 1999 unification agreement, which envisaged close political, economic, and military ties but stopped short of forming a single nation."
How Long Will The Oil Price War Actually Last.html,"The last few weeks have been humbling for those of us who make prognostications about the direction the oil markets may take. Especially so for the bulls, folks who think for whatever reason, oil should go up in price. Since mid-2014 that notion, with a few brief respites that analysts often call a “sucker’s bounce,” has proven to be continuously false. Every “buy on the dip,” recommendation has turned to compounded losses for energy investors, particularly those who dipped their toes into North American shale. The failure of OPEC+ (which we will discuss a little later in the article) to come to an agreement on further cuts was the breaking point for many investors resulting in a market looking for price discovery for oil and not finding it until the ~$30 level. On Monday, March 8thoil fell farther than it had ever done so before in a single day, dropping 24 percent before settling at $31.13/bbl. There is much discussion in the market now as to what effect this will have on shale drillers who seemed to have been dancing a credit, and wells productivity tight-rope the last couple of years. This in a relatively benign market that saw prices in the $55.00-60/bbl, where most agreed they could thrive. Most had seen share prices decline since the heady days of 2017, so surviving on cheap credit to drill new wells is probably a more apt term than thrive. What holds for them now that oil is $25-30 a barrel less in the space of a couple of months? Being an analytical sort of fellow I like to look back at past indicators of economic trends to help me understand the present and try and forecast the future. In this article we will review highlights of the last Dallas Fed Energy survey. First a brief Introduction to the U.S. Federal Reserve System Some background for international and lay readers. The Federal Reserve System is the chief instrument of regulating monetary policy in the United States of America, and is sometimes referred as the Central Bank. It was established in 1913 to control banking panics, by the congressional passage of the Federal Reserve Act. It has two primary remits. Promotion of maximum employment, and stabilizing prices. In practice it has broad powers to regulate the supply of money and facilitate the stability of the banking system. Its actions were primarily responsible for the U.S. recovery from the market crash of 2008. It is comprised of twelve regional District Banks, and Region 11 monitors the geographic area that includes the Permian Basin. This region is known as the Dallas Fed.  Source- Federal Reserve site As part of its remit, the Dallas Fed conducts a quarterly survey of energy executives that participate in the Permian and South Texas oil and gas markets. It is an anonymous exercise, so we don't know who the cohort is that makes up the responses, but its broad enough (161 firms participating) that we can give some credence to it. We spend time on this in part because of its focus on the Permian which I view as being the only shale play that matters. I've made this point previously due to the quality, extent, and oiliness of the Permian. All the others are gassier, thinner, and don't have the logistical advantages of the Permian. This was discussed in a prior article in OilPrice a couple of months ago. With this preamble, let's dive in. Price expectations for WTI What this first chart reveals is there were some fairly rosy expectations for the crude price for the coming year in about half of the respondents. A lot that optimism was probably the result of the Phase-1 trade deal with China, which although not signed until late Jan, 2020, was pretty much in place by the time of the survey. It didn't take long for the professional analysts to begin revising their global growth forecasts higher. On the positive side, market sentiment has been boosted by tentative signs that manufacturing activity and global trade are bottoming out, a broad-based shift toward accommodative monetary policy, intermittent favorable news on US-China trade negotiations, and diminished fears of a no-deal Brexit, leading to some retreat from the risk-off environment that had set in at the time of the October WEO. However, few signs of turning points are yet visible in global macroeconomic data. IMF As with all of these it’s sometimes funny to look back and see what was expected vs what turned out to be the case. ""No Deal Brexit,"" for example, remember that one? As it turned out that's exactly what happened.

googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1555424664620-0');});


 Of course, no sooner was the ink dry on that report than news of Covid-19 began to seep in the market, quickly washing away any benefit expectation from the trade deal with China. I imagine the IMF would like to bury this report.  Dallas Fed With advent of the spat between the Saudis and Russia a new price era is in store for shale. Its early days and we will have to see how this plays out. There are arguments for and against the two countries patching up their differences. Both are persuasive. Time will tell.  Related: Crashing Oil Prices Force U.S. Oil Firms To Cut Budgets Expectations for capital spending in 2020 As you might then expect from the price chart above, projections for capex devoted to shale were tilted to the bullish side, with 60 percent of respondents indicating they would hold firm or increases slightly. Only about 8 percent intended to plow big gobs of new capital into shale drilling.  Dallas Fed I find this to be moderately encouraging. Most survey takers - 65 percent - were holding firm or decreasing capex somewhat. 22 percent planned to seriously rein in capex, indicating to me that even the near to low $50's were getting for WTI just a few short weeks ago wasn't delivery the kind of returns needed to stay in business long term. With oil likely to rebound to the mid-$30s and stay there until shale production starts to decline (a topic we will address shortly), or there is some unexpected rapprochement in OPEC+ (something I am starting to doubt after initially leaning that way.) Price needed to generate Net Positive Cash Flow This is a little stunning to be honest. 60 percent of the firms that replied to this question need prices higher than $50/bbl. 38 percent need prices over $55.  Dallas Fed Only about 13 percent said they could make money in the most likely price scenario for WTI, with a bare 5-ish percent below cash flow positive at the present $34-ish price. My conclusion would be that many of those in the upper 60 percent will be reducing activity dramatically in this new price era. I will have more commentary on this in the ""Your Takeaway"" section. DUC's Drilled but UnCompleted wells have helped to grow production over the last year, even as new drilling has declined. This chart from Rystad suggests that one reason for this is it substantially cheaper to bring these on than drill new wells.  Rystad To be honest here, the logic of this graph escapes me, although its point is plain-many DUCs are uneconomic at today's crude price. It suggests that for 80 percent of DUCs breakeven pricing is around $25/bbl. That seems awfully low. Perhaps if they are talking about DUCs that have already been fracked, then that might make sense. One problem with DUCs is how they are classified. The EIA (the main semi-reliable source of hard data pertaining to oil) doesn't provide information on just what was done to a well before P&Aing (Plugging and Abandoning). There is reasonable cause to question whether a completion was actually installed prior to P&Aing. That's because ~70 percent of the cost of the well lies in the completion.  Related: Saudi Arabia Strikes Back At Russia In Key Oil Market If you were operating wells, would you spend ~$6 mm to install a completion and then put into DUC storage? There might be reasons for you to do just that-perhaps the pipeline connection isn't ready for example. There may be others that escape me now. But, more often than not if you've got $6-8 mm tied up in a well, you'd like to turn it around as quickly as possible. Notions that DUCs will keep the monthly EIA daily oil production tally rolling higher are probably misplaced. Why spend money to lose money? (Although I could be chided for asking this questioning of folks who collectively have managed to never have produced free cash flow, while accumulating 200 bn in debt.) Food for thought. Your takeaway What the Dallas Fed Survey reveals is there was quite a bit of exuberance in the minds of the oil company execs in December, of 2019. Perhaps it was because it was close to Christmas, and no one had heard of Covid-19 yet. No article on shale production would be complete these days, since OPEC+ fell apart anyway, without a comment on that stalemate. Cutting the way to higher prices was always doomed to failure with shale roaring ahead. What's puzzling is that it took so long to figure this out. After all they'd been doing this for a couple of years, while shale production...just ate their lunch. The point of another cut escaped the Russians who have a bit of a chip on their shoulder toward America to begin with thanks to sanctions on some of their key oil players, like Rosneft and its Nord Stream II pipeline. Now it appears the Saudis are catching on that it's time to apply some tough love to their American shale counter parts. My bet over the short haul is this is going to happen. Both countries understand who the real enemy is and are taking direct aim at “Bubba” in the Texas oilpatch. Longer term, fair questions have to be asked. Do the Russians really want to spend down their ~$570 bn cash reserves selling cheap oil? They’ve been making a killing off relatively high oil prices the last decade, and there’s no guarantee they can amass a fortune like this again. On the flip side, can the Saudis maintain this for very long, given their own funding shortfall. They too have a bunch of cash, but are in the same pickle as the Russians, when it’s gone, it’s gone. The answer may lie in just how fast shale production falls. Taking all of this information into account what can we expect from Permian operators post the OPEC+ debacle? Drilling will fall off a cliff. The last Baker Hughes survey reported a Permian count of about 404 rigs last week. I think this week it will be down another 50 and likely be cut in half over the next month. Using simple sums a 200 rig drop would take 160 K bopd off the market. DUCs will remain stagnant if we can believe the Rystad chart noted above. When the decline in drilling, and DUCs remaining in inventory, are added to the natural decline rate for shale it means we might see another half million barrels a day fall in production over the next month or so. Conceivably about -800 K BOEPD in a very short period. In short low prices, the thing that will kill off about half the shale industry will be the very thing that the rest of shale producers need to get the price back to levels where they can make money. As I stated in my last article for OilPrice, “What’s Next For North American Shale,” the future of shale belongs to big companies with; Great rock, naturally advantaged oil-prone reservoirs, Superior technology, the ability to frac in 4D as an example, Logistical advantages, raw material supply chain in basin, Low cost of production, relates to naturally advantaged reservoirs, but includes the ability to drill more wells with less money than competitors, Economy of scale, massive acreage positions that enable multi-well pads for efficient draining of the reservoir. I think better days lie ahead for the survivals, but expect rough times in the interim."
Saudi Arabia Strikes Back At Russia In Key Oil Market.html,"The world’s top oil exporter Saudi Arabia is going after Russia’s oil market share in Europe with deeply discounted Arab Light crude at up to three times the usual volumes, people with knowledge of European refiners’ operations told Bloomberg on Thursday. The Saudis, OPEC’s de facto leader and top producer, are aiming to grab market share from Russia in the oil price war it launched on Moscow to punish it for refusing to back deeper OPEC+ production cuts last week. And Europe is a key battleground in the new oil wars as Russia’s Urals crude has traditionally been a popular choice among European refiners. Saudi Arabia hasn’t seen Europe as a core market in recent years because it has prioritized continuously growing demand in Asian markets. But in the war of market share, the Kingdom is now looking to squeeze Russian oil out of Europe by offering deep discounts which make its Arab Light crude priced at as low as $25 a barrel at Rotterdam, much lower than the price of Urals.

googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1555424664620-0');});


 If prices of Urals and other crude grades going into Europe don’t drop to match the Saudi discounts, Saudi Arabia is set to “push out” the Urals grade from the refiners’ diet, Energy Aspects’ chief oil analyst Amrita Sen said in a note, as carried by Bloomberg.  Related: The Reason Why Russia Refused To Cut Oil Production The price of Urals has also slumped in recent days, but it needs to drop further to become appealing to European refiners, given the hefty Saudi discounts, traders told Reuters on Wednesday. Saudi Arabia has promised to flood the oil market with an extra 2.6 million bpd of oil from April, while its fellow OPEC producer and ally, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), pledged an additional 1 million bpd in supply. This will result in a total increase of 3.6 million bpd in global oil supply from OPEC’s heavyweights at a time of depressed oil demand due to the coronavirus outbreak and at a time of crashing oil prices, following the abrupt end to the OPEC+ deal last week. Russia, for its part, claims it can live with $25 oil for years and says it can raise its oil production by 200,000 bpd to 300,000 bpd in the short term, with a potential for up to a total increase of 500,000 bpd.   "
Why Fracking Will Never Be Banned In The US.html,"Several democratic presidential candidates have proposed fracking bans, but oil companies have room to breathe easily knowing that killing off fracking in the US is a bit too big of a bite for any political party to handle. But as environmental issues continue to remain front and center in the media, fracking has become a rather easy target that offers political candidates a juicy platform from which they can woo voters.  But is their plan to ban fracking really feasible? And doesn’t the American shale patch already have enough--and bigger--enemies? Fracking Explained Fracking--also called hydraulic fracturing--is a drilling process that involves injecting a high-pressure mixture containing water, sand, and chemicals into shale rock, which fractures the rock and releases the oil and gas that is trapped inside. The process often involves horizontal drilling. The Benefits of Fracking The benefits of fracking are numerous. In the United States, the introduction of fracking has completely turned the energy industry upside down, increasing the amount of oil and gas produced in the US “faster than at any time in its history,” according to the EIA, and increasing America’s energy independence in the process. Fracking has also brought down energy prices. Environmentally speaking, fracking has managed to lower carbon emissions by displacing a fair amount of carbon-intensive coal, which is now on the skids.  The entire country is a beneficiary of the fracking boom, without question. And today, 95% of all wells drilled in the US are fracked, according to the API. The Problem with Fracking Nevertheless, fracking has its drawbacks, and environmentalists--and the Democratic party that serves them--have singled out fracturing as a one-dimensional evil that must be stopped, at all costs.  Related: U.S. Sanctions Have Crippled Iranian Oil Production The argument against fracking is that the process of fracturing the earth to release tight oil causes earthquakes. The other argument is that injecting chemicals into the earth is polluting nearby aquifers. Both issues have long been debated.

 All Aboard the Anti-Fracking Movement! If you’re a Democrat of the far-left leaning variety, you’re likely already on the anti-fracking train. Political candidates such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren--the latter of whom is no longer in the running for President--jumped on board early and were extremely vocal against fracking.  That leaves Sanders, who is also having a bit of trouble in the polls, as the anti-fracking movement’s best champion.  “Any proposal to avert the climate crisis must include a full fracking ban on public and private lands,” Sanders tweeted last September.  Sanders even teamed up with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others to propose a federal bill to “phase out” fracking nationwide, known as the Ban Fracking Act. The act would start with banning new federal permits for fracking-related infrastructure immediately. Then, by 2021, fracking within 2500 feet of homes and schools would be banned. By 2025, the act would ban fracking in the United States completely, according to Sanders’ website.  But some have argued that neither Sanders nor Warren understands the issue of fracking. It is also possible that neither Sanders nor Warren fully understands the implications of standing on a platform that would seek to ban fracking. But what would a fracking ban mean? The Wrath of the States A nationwide ban aside, which federally would be problematic as the states are the ones that regulate fracking, fracking-dependent states may not be too excited to endorse a candidate--democratic or not--who opposes fracking outright.  Related: Junk Status? Oil Nations Face Serious Credit Downgrades First, Pennsylvania, an important swing state, has enjoyed sucking off the fracking teat, much like it sucks off the coal teat. Democrats tried to take an anti-coal stance there during the last presidential election, but failed to win over the swing state, with Pennsylvania residents opting instead for the more fiscally minded “Trump digs coal” stance. Any anti-fracking candidates will struggle to swing this state back into blue territory.  Colorado, too, may prove challenging for candidates heralding the benefits of a fracking ban. Although a purple state, Big Oil has managed to do quite well here with quashing anti-oil ballot proposals in the past. Voters were asked in 2018 to weigh the merits of increased setbacks for oil and gas wells, which would have taken a significant portion of land off the table for oil and gas drilling. The environmentally friendly measure, however, was defeated. But Sanders managed to win the Democratic primary in Colorado taking this unforgiving stance, despite the fact that the American Petroleum Institute said a fracking ban would mean a loss of more than 350,000 jobs in Colorado.  New Mexico, too, would take a severe beating from any ban on its bread and butter activity of fracking. According to a study from the US Chamber of Commerce’s Global Energy Institute found that a fracking ban could cost the state nearly 16% of its workforce and cut away $86 billion in cumulative GDP through 2025.  Is it Even Feasible? CNN recently provided a fracking ban “fact check”, pointing out that banning fracking would require an act of Congress. A president without Congress could maybe ban it on federal lands, but private-land fracking would take more oomph than a president has.  Yes, a president could make fracking on private lands a far more difficult endeavor, but Big Oil (and the API) has already proven a worthy foe over other anti-oil legislation, and Big Oil’s win is near certainly. Warren and Sanders are unlikely to be in the dark on this near-certain outcome. Fracking regulations on federal lands have already been proposed in the past but were consequently ruled unlawful.  Like Sanders and Warren, surely the API must know that any full-on fracking ban proposal is a no-go. Still, the API is already putting on the gloves to go another round, with a passionate campaign to bring to light what it considers to be a devastating effect on the US energy industry and the whole economy.  A Far Greater Nemesis A far greater foe to fracking than any political candidate would be the market itself--the coronavirus and OPEC’s complete failure to reach a deal with Russia over production cuts have sent oil prices falling to scary lows. These low prices are likely the only immediate thing that the US fracking industry has to worry about at the moment. "
OPEC Now Sees Zero Growth In Global Oil Demand In 2020.html,"Due to the coronavirus outbreak weighing on economic growth, OPEC now sees global oil demand rising by mere 60,000 bpd in 2020 after it has slashed its forecasts by 920,000 bpd from last month’s assessment. In its closely watched Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) published on Wednesday, OPEC said that the near-zero growth projection for this year reflects slower global economic growth as a result of the spread of Covid-19 outside China.   The cartel now expects global economic growth at 2.4 percent this year, down from a forecast of 3.0-percent growth in last month’s report. “The tremendous impact that the Covid-19 outbreak had so far on economic growth has significantly impacted oil demand growth in 1Q20 and therefore led to a downward revision to show less than 0.1 mb/d growth for the entire year 2020,” OPEC said in its MOMR today.

googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1555424664620-0');});


 Last week, the cartel had already slashed once its estimates for oil demand growth, saying that demand was expected to grow by 480,000 bpd in 2020, compared to expectations of 1.1-million-bpd growth in December. Earlier this week, the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned that oil demand was set to drop this year for the first time since the financial crisis in 2009, due to the coronavirus outbreak and its impact on economies. The IEA now sees global demand falling by 90,000 bpd year on year in 2020. OPEC, for its part, said today that the Covid-19 outbreak and its adverse impacts on transportation and industrial fuels were the main factors prompting the cartel to expect nearly zero growth in oil demand this year, compared to initial forecasts of more than 1.1 million bpd growth.  Related: Don't Be Fooled By The Oil Price Rebound “Considering the latest developments, downward risks currently outweigh any positive indicators and suggest further likely downward revisions in oil demand growth, should the current status persist,” OPEC warned. On the supply side, OPEC expects non-OPEC supply growth at 1.8 million bpd this year, down by 500,000 bpd from the previous projection, mainly reflecting a further slowdown in US shale production. The most recent oil price collapse will hurt future production in the U.S. and Canada, OPEC said, while “most oil exporters from the Middle-East and Africa have production costs, that are much lower than the current oil price level and therefore, their production level could be largely maintained.” “The recent decline in oil price could not have happened at a worse time, as the Covid-19 outbreak has wiped out global oil demand growth for 2020 and caused a strong negative global economic impact, which is expected to continue and worsen if the virus is not controlled,” OPEC said. Without mentioning the collapse of the OPEC+ talks last week, which triggered the price collapse and the all-out oil price war, OPEC noted that “The impact of the Covid-19 related developments on an already fragile global economic situation is quite challenging and requires coordinated global policy action of all market participants.”   "
Mexicos Oil Hedge Just Saved Its Economy.html,"Petroleos Mexicanos has been in an unrelenting downward spiral for decades. Pemex, Mexico’s state-owned oil company, has seen a vast and speedy decline of its production rates for the last 15 years, and at times it has vied for position as the most indebted oil company in the world, with “about $105 billion of bonds and loans outstanding,” according to the Wall Street Journal, a figure that has almost certainly grown since that figure was released last year.  Leftist Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who won the 2018 presidential election in a landslide, used his planned improvements for Pemex as a central part of his platform. He promised to revive the ailing production numbers, crack down on the company’s rampant corruption scandals, and put an end to Mexico’s brazen and voluminous fuel theft. So far, many of those strategies have backfired.  President López Obrador’s flagship Pemex revival project has been the Dos Bocas refinery in his home state of Tabasco. The project was determined by experts to be dead in the water before developers had even broken ground on the refinery that the president promised would be the first step in the long road of recovery to making Mexican oil production great again. Now, the President’s pet project is getting even more negative attention amidst concerning and widespread reporting that the development has caused widespread and illegal environmental damage, including the destruction of protected mangroves.   Related: The Oil Price War Has Only Just Begun

 As for cracking down on corruption, López Obrador did take serious steps to clean out some of the long-corrupt ranks of Pemex, but the backlash was severe as investors fled amidst the turmoil. The company reported a 36 billion-peso ($1.9 billion U.S. dollars) loss in the first quarter after López Obrador took the helm, and Moody’s Investors Service dropped the company to its lowest investment-grade rating last summer. “Instead of instilling more confidence in investors that Pemex is heading in the right direction, the sweeping corruption probes have, in fact, give many investors pause by adding to the perception that the company is both unstable and vulnerable,” Oilprice reported in July. “Investors are less interested in seeing [López Obrador’s administration] root out bad apples at Pemex than they are in his containing the spreading rot on its balance sheet,” Bloomberg Businessweek reported in the same week. “At more than $100 billion, its debt is the biggest of any oil company.”  Now, as crude prices drop and markets experience major volatility between the corona virus and the oil price war raging between Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the United States, Pemex has been hit hard--really hard. On Tuesday the company’s bonds hit a record low, and in the last quarter, their losses were a devastating $9 billion.   Related: Only 5 Shale Drillers Are Still Profitable At $31 Oil Despite this, officials from Pemex claim that there will be no direct harm to the Mexican government's budget. As reported by Reuters earlier this week, “Mexico's Finance Minister Arturo Herrera said on Tuesday a $1.37 billion hedge program completely covered 2020 national oil income following a steep drop in crude prices.” Speaking on Mexican TV network Televisa, Herrera told his interviewer that, “on the income side we're covered, there will not be a direct impact on the budget,"" Herrera said in a interview with TV station Televisa. The Reuters report continues: “In January, the government said the finance ministry's hedge had a total cost of $1.37 billion. It has not disclosed how many barrels the hedge covers but said it had secured the price of $49 a barrel set in the 2020 budget. Mexico produces some 1.73 million barrels of crude a day.”  This rate of production is not enough to keep Pemex afloat, and, as such, the company has been bleeding money for years, making it reliant on government handouts. “The protection is largely provided by put options, a financial instrument,” Reuters specifies, “but most years also includes backing from a budget stabilization fund to guarantee government revenue.” It’s looking extremely unlikely that this year will be an exception. "
Saudi Arabia Prepares To Flood The Market With Even More Oil.html,"The Saudi Energy Ministry has told Aramco to increase its oil production capacity to 13 from 12 million bpd, the company’s chief executive Amin Nasser said in a statement as quoted by Reuters. The news comes on the heels of an Aramco filing with the Saudi bourse that it would raise oil production next month to 12.3 million bpd. According to the filing, Aramco “will provide its customers with 12.3 million barrels per day (MMBD) of crude oil in April; i.e., an increase of 300 thousand barrels per day over the Company’s maximum sustained capacity (MSC) of 12 MMBD.”

 However, the current capacity of the company is around 12 million bpd, suggesting it would take oil from storage to hit its April production target. If it plans to keep the pressure on for longer, it would clearly need to increase production capacity. “The company is exerting its maximum efforts to implement this directive as soon as possible,” Nasser said in the statement. Saudi Arabia took to arms this weekend, after Russia said it would not participate in deeper production cuts, with Energy Minister Alexander Novak adding the country’s oil companies will resume normal production from April. This could add some 300,000 bpd to current production rates or up to 500,000 bpd. Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, has been cutting a lot more than its quota, so it has more barrels to add to global markets. These intentions also signal it was unwilling to resume talks with Russia, which the Russian side had said were not off the table despite their disagreement on deeper cuts. Saudi Arabia is also cutting the prices of its oil. At between $6 and $8 per barrel, the cuts will be the deepest for buyers in northwestern Europe and the United States, the Saudi state company said over the weekend."
Oil Price War Escalates As OPECs No3 Boosts Production.html,"OPEC’s third biggest producer, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), is entering the oil price war as the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) said on Wednesday it was positioned to boost its supply to the market to over 4 million bpd in April, one million bpd higher than current production. The UAE has been pumping around 3 million bpd, in line with its commitment to stick to and even overcomply with the OPEC+ production cut deal, which fell apart last Friday.    “In line with our production capacity growth strategy announced by the Supreme Petroleum Council, we are in a position to supply the market with over 4 MMBPD in April,” ADNOC Group chief executive, Dr. Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, said in a statement.

 ADNOC, which pumps nearly all the oil in the UAE, is also accelerating plans to increase its production capacity to 5 million bpd, Al Jaber said. Commenting on the supply boost, Rystad Energy's Bjoernar Tonhaugen said: ''We expected similar announcements from other core-OPEC members, such as the UAE today, that crude production and capacity will be ramped-up following Saudi Arabia's announcement. We believe UAE can ramp up production to around 3.3-3.4 million bpd from their current output of ~3.0 million bpd in the short term, and will likely draw-down storage to supply clients additional barrels if there is enough demand for UAE barrels.''  Related: Big Oil Prepares To Suffer In 2020 The 1-million-bpd supply increase from the UAE in April adds to the 2.6 million bpd which Saudi Arabia promised to unleash on the oil market next month, resulting in a total increase of 3.6 million bpd in global oil supply from OPEC’s heavyweights at a time of depressed oil demand due to the coronavirus outbreak and at a time of crashing oil prices, following the abrupt end to the OPEC+ deal last week. Saudi Arabia’s oil giant Aramco will also begin to work on increasing its maximum sustainable capacity from 12 million bpd to 13 million bpd, as per Energy Ministry orders, the company said in a stock exchange filing on Wednesday. “The Company is exerting its maximum efforts to implement this directive as soon as possible,” Aramco’s president and CEO Amin Nasser said in a statement carried by the Saudi Press Agency. The promises of OPEC’s heavyweights to flood the market with oil were met by a Russian response that Moscow can raise its oil production by 200,000 bpd to 300,000 bpd in the short term, with a potential for up to a total increase of 500,000 bpd, as Russia also digs in for an oil price/market share war. The escalation in the promises for higher oil supply weighed on oil prices again on Wednesday after a brief respite on Tuesday. Early on Wednesday before the EIA inventory report, Brent Crude was plunging 3.4 percent at $35.95 and WTI Crude was down 3.26 percent at $33.24. "
Oil Falls Further On Soaring Crude Inventories.html,"Amid a new oil price rout sparked by the breakdown of the OPEC+ alliance the Energy Information Administration reported a crude oil inventory build of 7.7 million barrels for the week to March 6. This compares with a moderate build of 800,000 barrels for the previous week. However, the EIA also reported a sizeable gasoline and distillate fuel draws for the week to February 28. For the week to March 6, fuel inventories registered hefty inventory draws. In gasoline, the EIA reported an inventory decline of 5 million barrels for the first week of March, versus a decline of 4.3 million barrels for the previous week.

 In distillate fuels, the EIA reported an inventory fall of 6.4 million barrels for the week to March 6, versus a fall of 4 million barrels for the week before. Refineries last week processed 15.7 million bpd, producing 10 million bpd of gasoline and 4.7 million bpd of distillate fuel. This compares with 9.8 million bpd of gasoline production the previous week, and 4.6 million bpd in distillate fuel production. Meanwhile, oil prices have recouped some of their losses but nowhere near enough to settle the jittery oil market after the oil partnership between Russia and Saudi Arabia broke down last Friday with both now set on increasing production, in Saudi Arabia’s case to more than its production capacity.

Oil Nations Face Serious Credit Downgrades And yet, despite the break-up of the OPEC+ production cut agreement, “the doors aren’t closed” to future cooperation between Russia and OPEC, Russia’s Energy Minister Alexander Novak told local news channel Rossiya 24 on Tuesday. “The fact that the agreement was not extended beyond April 1 doesn’t mean that we cannot cooperate with OPEC and non-OPEC producers in the future. We signed a charter last year and we will continue cooperation as part of it,” Novak said. This means not all is lost in oil production control but before things get better they may well get worse, with independent U.S. shale producers bearing the brunt of the price row because of their high debt levels and rising breakeven prices. This, however, means U.S. production growth may slow down, which would be positive for prices regardless of how the price war develops."
